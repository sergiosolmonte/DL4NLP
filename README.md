Project on German metaphors detection with BERT  

Link for the trained model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LCMFoLyAjPvjaCdQo8CB58-Pg28TjM38?usp=sharing  
Here you can find the two models, the "mybert.pkl" is a bert-base-german-cased model trained with 5 epochs and "historicalbert.pkl" is trained only with 2 epochs because we want to compare our results with another experiment.  
In the results directory, you can find accuracy, f1-score, f1-score average, recall and the confusion matrix of both the models (historical and bert-german).
